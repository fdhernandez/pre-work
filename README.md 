**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: Flor Hernandez Rodriguez

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

Link to project: Code (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/light-and-sound-game-fhr) Live Site: (https://light-and-sound-game-fhr.glitch.me)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   - I used this source to help me align the start and stop button.
   https://coder-coder.com/how-to-center-button-with-html-css/
   - I used this website to find the colors for the buttons.
   https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   - One challenge I faced in the pre-work was constructing the code for the conditional logic inside the guess function. 
   I sometimes struggle with just looking at the code and knowing what to write next.  I started by sketching down the flow
   chart provided and writing down what each box represents as sometimes writing down things by hand allows me to process 
   them better. For instance for the lose game box I commented “Lose game if guess is incorrect” and for the win game box 
   I wrote “Win if guess is correct, if the turn is over, and if it is the last turn”. I did this with each path to be able
   to track how the logic will go into words and then minimized them. I was able to write the code for the conditional logic
   and checked if it was similar to the provided version. Another struggle I had was when I added button 6 to the game. As 
   I was going through the demo, my game kept crashing or letting me know I lost the game even when I guessed the correct button.
   Since the I knew the guessing was incorrect or at least was showing as incorrect I looked through my index.html file for an error.
   I was able to see how I mistakenly put button 6 as the onclick= “guess(5)” rather than (6). This immediately fixed my problem, 
   teaching me how one small error can corrupt the whole code. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   - After completing the pre-work I have some questions regarding the format of the HTML elements regarding the style. 
   Would we be taught what code to use to make our web page look professional as in how the buttons, text, information, 
   etc are aligned within the page. I understand how important it is for a website to not only look pleasing to the eyes
   but also be easy to follow. I would also like to gain a better understanding on how to apply URLs into our code in order
   to allow the user to continue to other tabs or links on our website. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   - If I had more time to work on this project as well a bit more knowledge, I would spend them making the game design more 
   entertaining for the player. I am not sure if it is possible, but I would like to make the buttons move or shift after the 
   player selects it and plays the sound. With the buttons having the image of different musical notes and by moving once selected 
   it would give the player the illusion of musical notes playing as you would see in a cartoon animation. Additionally, I would be
   interested in having a score counter and display to show the player their best score in the game. Most online games tend to keep
   the score in sight to encourage the player to keep playing the game. This would also aid in the website’s traffic as the player 
   will continue playing the game or share it with others to beat their score.
